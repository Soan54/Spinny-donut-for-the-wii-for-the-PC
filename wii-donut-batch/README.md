2. Navigate to the directory where the `donut.bat` file is located.
3. Run the batch file by typing `donut.bat` and pressing Enter.

## Description of the Spinning Donut Effect

The spinning donut effect is a classic demonstration of 3D graphics using ASCII art. It creates the illusion of a rotating donut shape by manipulating characters and their positions in the console window. This project aims to replicate that effect in a simple and accessible way using a batch script.
